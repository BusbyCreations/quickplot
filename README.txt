QuickPlot is a simple program for quickly plotting data stored in a tab delimited text file.  See "EXAMPLE.txt" for an example data file.

Note for Linux Users:
QuickPlot was created using the Qt Framework from Nokia, and requires that certain Qt libraries be installed on your computer.  You probably already have the correct libraries installed, but if not you can install these libraries from you distribution's repository.  For example, on Ubuntu you can use Synaptic to install libqt4-core and libqt4-gui, or from the command line do: sudo apt-get install libqt4-core libqt4-gui.
